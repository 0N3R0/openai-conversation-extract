COFFEE SHOP - DAY**\n\n*The coffee shop is cozy, filled with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. People are scattered at tables, sipping their drinks and chatting. JESSICA, in her late 20s, sits alone at a table by the window, typing on her laptop. Her coffee cup is half-full. Enter ALEX, early 30s, carrying a coffee cup and scanning the room.*\n\n**ALEX**  \n(spotting Jessica)  \nHey, Jessica! Mind if I join you?\n\n**JESSICA**  \n(looking up, surprised)  \nAlex! Of course, have a seat. What’s up?\n\n*Alex sits down, setting his coffee cup on the table.*\n\n**ALEX**  \nI didn’t expect to run into you here. I thought you’d be working from home today.\n\n**JESSICA**  \n(smiling)  \nI was, but I needed a change of scenery. The walls were starting to close in on me. What about you?\n\n**ALEX**  \nJust grabbing a coffee before heading to a meeting. This place makes the best lattes in town, don’t you think?\n\n**JESSICA**  \nDefinitely. I can’t resist their caramel macchiatos.\n\n**ALEX**  \nWell, since you’re here, how’s the project going?\n\n**JESSICA**  \n(stretching)  \nIt’s going well. I’m actually making good progress. How’s yours?\n\n**ALEX**  \nIt’s been a bit hectic. We’re pushing for a new launch, and everything seems to be happening at once. \n\n**JESSICA**  \nSounds intense. But you’re handling it, I’m sure.\n\n**ALEX**  \nTrying my best. (pauses) By the way, have you ever thought about taking a break? Like, really unplugging for a bit?\n\n**JESSICA**  \n(chuckles)  \nI’d love to, but there’s always something that needs doing. Why do you ask?\n\n**ALEX**  \nI’ve been thinking about it a lot lately. Maybe we should plan a weekend getaway or something. What do you think?\n\n**JESSICA**  \n(eyes lighting up)  \nThat sounds amazing. I could definitely use a break. Let’s do it!\n\n**ALEX**  \nGreat! I’ll start looking into some options. It’ll be nice to get away from all this craziness.\n\n*They both smile, enjoying the idea of a shared escape.*\n\n**JESSICA**  \nAbsolutely. Here’s to a much-needed break!\n\n**ALEX**  \nCheers to that.\n\n*They clink their coffee cups together, the warmth of the coffee shop and their newfound plan creating a comforting atmosphere.*\n\n**FADE OUT.**\n\n---\n\nHope you enjoyed it! If you have any specific adjustments or a different idea in mind, just let me know!"

It will prompt you to make choices for the characters, simulating a dialogue based on the options you choose."
